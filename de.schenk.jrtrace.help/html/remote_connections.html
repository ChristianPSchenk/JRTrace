<h1>How to perform a Remote Connection</h1>


If you want to connect to a remote host you need a several steps:

<ul>
<li>
It is required to install JRTRace on the target machine on which process is running.
</li>
<li>
On the target machine, install the agent into the target process to which you want to connect. 
</li>
<li>
Last select the proper connection parameters on the machine from which you want to connect (the development machine).
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Instrumenting the Target Process
</h2>
<p>
Basically there are two options: if you have a JDK for JRTrace to run: just select the target process in JRTrace on the target machine. In this case you
shouldn't select any project because the actual instrumentation will be done from the development machine.
If there is no JDK: use the "Copy Agent Parameters" button on the launch configuration tab and start the target process with the additional parameters 
that were copied to the clipboard.
</p>
<p>
Note: if your computer has more than one network interface, an additional drop down box will appear on top of the launch dialog. In this case it is
important to select the network interface to which the development machine will connect. 
</p>
<h2>
Connecting to the Target Process
</h2>
On the development machine, choose."Connect JRTrace Agent" and enter the ip address of the target machine. The port should be visible in the debug 
target description on the remote machine.

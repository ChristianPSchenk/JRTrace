<h1>JRTrace</h1>
JTrace (Java Runtime Trace) is a set of Eclipse Plugins for your Development Environment that helps to insert tracing and other code into running java virtual machines.

<p>
<b>Careful: JRTrace is invasive: it instruments the code and it is easy to inject wrong code that spoils application logic!</b>
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
The features of this plugin set will work properly only if the following requirements are fulfilled:

<ul>
<li>The JVM used to run the JRTrace plugins is Oracle JDK 7 or later (JDK, not JRE!)</li>
<li>Target VM also needs to be an Oracle VM 7 or later (JRE, JDK doesn't matter for the target...)</li>
<li>The JDK version that runs JRTrace must be at least the version of the target JVM</li>



</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Use Case: You have a huge java application that is running already and you just
 want to have a quick peek at the return value of some method and a short trace statement in another, because there is this tiny
  little problem that needs solving...
 </p>
 <p>
The Problem: the application is huge and takes long to start, or it cannot be stopped (because it's a server) or if you can restart
it you don't know how to pass in the right parameters to the JVM to load a debug client. And if you can debug, maybe this is not sufficient
because after all what you need is tracing and for that you also need the source code, but you need the source code of this particular
product and if you want to modify the code you need to compile the classes, replace the classes in the productive system, or start the application under the debugger control so
you can do hot code replace. Then you want to know why the same problem was not there in that other version of your huge application
and you need the new code and basically include again the same tracing code. Later you need to get rid of the tracing code, make it possible to enable/disable it or store it
somewere else to inject it in the same code later again.
</p>  
<p>
The Solution: at least for Windows/Linux and Oracle JVM this JRTrace Add-On for Eclipse can help.
You can select an arbitrary class and method and instruct JRTrace to add tracing, inspect variables, print the stacktrace. The basic 
features are pretty easy to use, but the tool allows for nearly everything...


</p>

<h2>Getting Started: a Simple Tutorial...</h2>
 
 <h3>Installation</h3>
 
 Install the JRTrace Eclipse Plugins Feature from the update site, done.
 
 <h3>Create an Application</h3>
 <p>
 
 JRTrace inserts tracing and logging logic into running applications. For testing purposes
 just create a Java application with one main class. For this example the following application
 should be running, which just prints some message every second.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In this tutorial it will be demonstrated how the calls to the <code>doit</code> method can be traced using JRTrace.
 </p>
 
<pre>
package testproject;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args)  {
		for(int i=0;i<1000;i++)
		{
			doit(i);
		}
	}
	public static void doit(int i) 
	{
		System.out.println(String.format("doing it %d",i));
		try {
			Thread.sleep(1000);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
		// do nothing
		}
	}
}
 </pre>
 
 <h3>Create a JRTrace Project</h3>
 
 <img src="pics/project1.png"></img>
 
 <p>
 Create a JRTrace project using the "File -> New -> Project" menu. Just finish using 
 the default settings. 
 </p>
 
 <h3>Create a JRTrace rule class</h3>
 
 The actual tracing code is defined via JRTrace Rules which are annotated java classes. For this example
 replace the auto-generated example with this class:

<pre> 
package de.schenk.jrtrace.libs;

import de.schenk.jrtrace.helperlib.HelperLib;
import de.schenk.jrtrace.annotations.XClass;
import de.schenk.jrtrace.annotations.XMethod;

@XClass (classes="testproject.Main")
public class SampleHelperLib extends HelperLib
{
	@XMethod(names="doit")
	public void showHelp()
	{
		System.out.println("I'm here.");
		traceStack();
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
Basically this class tell JRTrace to print "I'm here" whenever the application enters the  method "doit" in the
class "testpackage.Main". The <code>traceStack()</code> call will also print the current stack to the console.

</p>
<p>
Just refer to the <a href="javadoc\index.html">javadoc</a>
 of the <code>de.schenk.jrtrace.annotations</code> package for a full overview on the features.
Basically you can execute method on enter or exit of methods, use regular expressions to match class- and methodname, 
inject the values of fields, call arguments and the return value into the tracing method and even execute the tracing
code in the scope of different classloaders.
</p> 
 
 <h3>Create and Start the JRTrace Launch Configuration</h3>
 <p> 
 To insert this rule we need to connect to the target process. Create a new JRTrace Debug Configuration and use the following settings:
 </p>
 <img src="pics/launch1.png"></img>
 
 
 <p>On <code>Debug</code> JRTrace will be launched with these parameters. JRTrace identifies the project to connect to based on the process description line, which usually contains the Main class that was started (<code>testproject.Main</code> in this case).
 JRTrace will use the selected <code>exampleJRTraceProject</code>. 
 </p>
 <p>
 JRTrace will create a new console which will automatically capture the output and error streams of the application under test. 
 In addition the console will show the output from the injected rules.
 In addition there will be a running debug shown in the Debug view from which it is possible to terminate the session or reconnect.
 </p>
 <img src="pics/target1.png"></img>
 
 <p>
 Finally to deploy all JRTrace classes in the tracing project to the target application the project needs to be selected and the "Deploy JRTrace project" button <img src="pics/upload_java_16.gif"></img> needs to be pressed.
 
 </p>
 
 <p>For this example ths content of the JRTrace console will look like this: </p>
 <pre>
doing it 176
I'm here
Stack trace for thread main
testproject.Main.doit(Main.java:-1)
testproject.Main.main(Main.java:7)
doing it 177
I'm here
Stack trace for thread main
testproject.Main.doit(Main.java:-1)
testproject.Main.main(Main.java:7)
 </pre>
 <h3>Incremental Work</h3>
 <p>
 JRTrace classes can be changed and redeployed. Change the code and add for example: 
 </p>
 <pre>
 throw new RuntimeException("done");
 </pre>
 <p> Then save the file and redeploy it to the target. This will cause the target VM to throw a <code>RuntimeException</code> and will
 thus terminate the target process</p>
 
 
 
<h2>Users Guide</h2>



<h3>Launch Options</h3>

<p>
There are two options provided to connect to a target machine:
<ul>
<li>
Upload JRTrace Agent: By specifying the operating system process based on the process id or by a part of the text in its process description. If this option is used, JRTrace will require to
run with a JDK and will upload the required JRTrace agent into the target process itself and connect to it.
</li>
<li>
Connnect to JRTrace Agent: By launching the target JVM with parameters to include the JRTrace java agent and by specifying the port. JRTrace will then expect a running target machine JRTrace agent to which
it can connect.
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h4>Upload JRTrace Agent</h4>

If the "Upload JRTrace Agent" checkbox is enabled, the following options can be used to specify the 
target process to use:

<ul>
<li>
Enter or select a process ID. If a process ID is selected the launch will try to connect to this and only this PID.
</li>
<li>
Enter a substring of the process description in the "Identify Text" field. Check the "Select PID" button to see the descriptions of all
currently running processes. Upon launch, JRTrace will find all processes containing this text and connect if there is exactly one. 
</li>
<li>
If the auto connect checkbox is enabled, JRTrace will begin the launch and poll for new JVMs. It will connect to the first java process that is launched on the machine after 
starting the debug session.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Connect to JRTrace Agent</h4>

<p>
If the "Connect" option is selected, the target JVM in which the code is to be injected needs to be started with the proper
arguments to include the JRTrace java agent into the target. The port will then specify the port on which the target machine is listening
for connections.

</p>
<p>
The "Copy Java Parameters" button will automatically copy the proper snippet including the port and the path to the two required jar files to the clipboard for your convenience.
This snippet can be pasted into your start script. 

</p>
<h4>Auto Upload</h4>
<p>
If the auto upload checkbox is enabled, JRTrace will automatically 
upload the project connected to the launch configuration and deploy it as JRTrace project into the target.
 
</p>


<h4>Associating a Project with a JRTrace Launch</h4>

A JRTrace tracing session relies on the tracing code from the selected JRTrace project. Basically all Java classes from the selected project will be uploaded
as JRTrace classes into the target JVM. If a project doesn't appear in the selection dialog, it most likely isn't a JRTrace project yet. Any Java or Plugin
project can be converted to a JRTrace project using the project context menu "Configure as  -> JRTrace Project".

<p>
Note: the "New JRTrace Project" wizard will create a Java project, add the JRTrace nature to mark it as a JRTrace project and add the required JRTrace libraries
to the projects library path. These libraries contain the JRTrace annotations and the helper libraries. Such a project can be converted to a Plugin
project any time. Or vice versa: a Plugin-Project can be configured as JRTrace project. However to add JRTrace annotations it is also required to add the
JRTrace libraries to the build path via Build Path -> Add Library -> JRTrace Libraries
</p>

<p>
Note: as of today, only the classes from the bin folder will be deployed into the target VM. Additional Jar files need to be present in the target already 
since they will not be injected.
</p>




<h3>JRTrace Commands</h3>
<h4>Deploy JRTrace project</h4>

<p>The <img src="pics/upload_java_16.gif"/>-menu/toolbar will re-/deploy the connected java project into the target 
application. This will effectively remove all previously deployed JRTrace classes from the target and replace them with the contents of the project.
There is no restrictions on changes to the classes (e.g. including/removing static fields is always possible).

</p>

<h4>Run a Method on a JRTrace Class</h4>

<p>It is possible to explicitly invoke a method without arguments on any 
JRTrace class using the <img src="pics/run_java_16.gif"/>-menu/toolbar. The dialog shown below will ask for the name of the JRTrace class
(fully qualified name), the name of the method to invoke (a method without parameters!). Optionally it is also possible to
specify the name of a class to use to obtain the classloader. This is only relevant if the <code>classloaderpolicy</code> of the specified
JRTrace class is <code>TARGET</code>. In this case it will be used to determine the classloader to use. For policies <code>BOOT</code> and <code>NAMED</code>
the classloader is determined from the JRTrace class as specified (boot classloader or named classloader).

<p>The classes/objects on which the code is invoked are created in the manner as for normal JRTrace instrumentations. </p>

<img src="pics/runjavadialog.png"></img>

 

<h3>JRTrace Helper Class</h3>

<p>
The JRTrace class includes a small utility class that might be useful in some tracing use cases:
<code>de.schenk.jrtrace.helperlib.HelperLib</code>
To use the  utility methods extend your classes from <code>HelperLib</code> and use them from your instrumentation code. Alternatively just create an instance of the class to use it.
</p>


<h4>traceStack</h4>

<code>traceStack</code> is a convenience method to write the current stack trace to the output.
<code>traceStack(int depth)</code> will restrict the number of shown stack lines to the <code>depth</code>



<h4>inspect</h4>
<p>
The inspect method reflectively dumps the contents of an arbitrary object by recursively 
printing and following all properties and references. The simplest use is to call
<code>inspect(object)</code>. This will dump the first 3 hierarchies of an object. See the javadoc of the HelperLib class
it will detail the other parameters.
<pre>
inpect(Object o,int depth,String toStringClass, String excludeFields, boolean includeStatics,String detailFormatter)
</pre>
<code>o</code>: the object to inspect</br>
<code>depth</code>: the recursion depth how deep to follow the object</br>
<code>toStringClasses</code>: a comma separated list of classnames (not necessarily qualified). If encountering classes of this type, toString() is used on the value</br>
<code>excludeFields</code>: a comma separated list of field names. Fields with these names will not be followed</br>
<code>includeStatics</code>: will include static fields in the inspection</br>
<code>detailFormatter</code>: use a custom formatter for specified fields. 
This argument has to be of the format 'fieldname=methodname[,fieldname2=methodname2]'.
Whenever inspect encounters a field with the specified name, it will invoke the method with the specified name on the current HelperLib object (and the type of the field as argument; 
boxed: Integer instead of int) to
get the formatted value. To use this feature, <code>HelperLib</code> has to be extended and the required detail formatter methods have to be added to the subclass.  


</p>

<h4>setField</h4>


While <code>@XField</code> can be used to obtain the values of fields of the currently instrumented object, it is not possible to manipulate those values. <code>setField</code> reflectively modifies a given field:
<pre>
setField(target,fieldname, value);
</pre>

<code>target</code>: the object -OR- the <code>Class</code> that contains the field. Pass the object instance for non-static and the <code>Class</code> for static fields.</br>
<code>fieldname</code>: the name of the field to set</br>
<code>value</code>: the new value</br>

<h4>getField</h4>


Even though <code>@XField</code> can be used to obtain the values of fields of the currently instrumented object, sometimes it is just more convenient to 
use plain reflection. The <code>getField</code> methods use reflection to obtain the specified fields:
<pre>
getField(String className,String fieldName);
getField(Class<?> clazz,String fieldName);
getField(Object object,String fieldName);
</pre>


<code>className, clazz</code>: the name of the class / class to access static fields</br>
<code>object</code>: the object for instance fields</br>
<code>fieldname</code>: the name of the field to set</br>



<h2>Remarks on Techniques and Design</h2>

<h3>How to obtain the JDK tools.jar</h3>

To connect to a remote VM and install agents the VirtualMachine class is required, which is part of the tools.jar of the JDK.
This is not easily accessible in Eclipse unless special boot parameters etc. are used.
The workaround is this:
A wrapper bundle (com.sun.tools) was prepared and exports the packages in tools.jar
Since it is legally problematic to ship the tools.jar, it is removed from the plugin
To get it, the plugin structure is such that the jdkinit plugin is activate before the com.sun.tools and will copy the tools.jar from the current jdk to the 
expected location in com.sun.tools.
This works only if the jrtrace tool is run with a JDK! 

<h3>ClassLoader Topics</h3>

All JRTrace classes are loaded using a special classloader. This JRTrace classloader will first try to look up classes in the JRTrace classes and then delegate to the parent
classloader. Therefore all JRTrace classes will be able to access all other JRTrace classes and by default will have the boot classloader as parent classloader. However using annotations it is possible to use the classloader of the target class
as a parent classloader, or even to specify a class that will be used to identify the classloader.

For example assume that you want to instrument all calls to <code>IResourceChangeListener</code>s in an Eclipse application. By default the injected code will not be able to access any class
of the <code>org.eclipse.core.resources</code> plugins. However by specifying <code>classloaderpolicy=XClassLoaderPolicy.NAMED, classloadername=org.eclipse.core.resources.ResourcesPlugin</code> the 
JRTrace code will be loaded using a classloader that delegates (uses as a parent...) to the same classloader that loaded the <code>ResourcesPlugin</code> class. Thus effectively
all classes from the Eclipse Resources plugin are available and can be used in the instrumentation.

Note that it is also possible to specify <code>XClassLoaderPolicy.TARGET</code>. In this case, the injected code is loaded with the same classloader as a parent as the code
into which it gets injected. Note that in this particular case, the same class might be injected into code that with different classloaders. In this case, several instances of the
corresponding injected JRTrace class might be available in the JVM. Be careful in such cases: static fields will only be valid in the scope of a classloader.

<h2>FAQ / Known Issues</h2>

<h3>Internal Error (jvmtiRedefineClasses.cpp:489), pid=####, tid=####
#  Error: ShouldNotReachHere()</h3>

In some cases I observed that the target vm terminated when uploading the JRTrace instrumentation. This was the error:
<pre>
# Internal Error (jvmtiRedefineClasses.cpp:489), pid=####, tid=###
#  Error: ShouldNotReachHere()
</pre>
This is a JDK bug <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8035150">JDK-8035150</a> and resolved in Java 1.8.0_b4. Try running your application with a 
more recent java version.
<h3>Internal Error (ci/ciEnv.hpp:172) Error: ShouldNotReachHere()</h3>

In some cases (fortunately happened only in heavy load test cases for me until now) the JVM might crash with the above error. This is unfortunately not fixed until 1.8.0_31. The bug was already
reported to Oracle as <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8023901">JDK-8023901</a> but closed as "Cannot Reproduce". I have filed another request.
 


<h3>Unsupported Class Version</h3>
 If a helper library is compiled on Java 8 or higher and jrtrace injects it into a running Java 7, this will result in the <code>UnsupportedClassVersionError</code>.
 Ensure that all your helper libraries are compiled for java 7 compliance. If jrtrace runs on Java 8, ensure that the java settings for the helper libraries are set to produce
 Java 7 class files.

<h1>Annotation Reference   - incomplete, refer to the JavaDoc for now -</h1>

The general concept of JRTrace requires one or more classes that are annotated. The annotations specify if, where and which methods
will be injected into the running application.



 <table border="1" style="width:100%"  >
  <tr>
    <th>Annotation</th>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@XClass</code></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>A class that can be used with JRTrace. If a class is installed using JRTrace without annotations, 
    this is equivalent to using <code>@XClass()</code>.
    </td>
 
   
   </tr>
    <tr>
    <td></td> 
    <td><code>names</code></td>
    
    <td>One or more fully qualified class names. If set, the methods in this class can only be injected into classes with the
    same qualified name. If not set, this class can inject in all classes. Use with care: usually it is a bad idea to instrument all
    classes including the java core classes.
    <p>Example: injection of methods from this class is restricted to classes <code>a.b.C</code> and <code>d.e.F</code>
    <pre>
    @XClass(names={"a.b.C","d.e.F"})
    class Trace
    {
    }
    </pre>
    </p>
    </td>
    
     <tr>
    <td></td> 
    <td><code>regex</code></td>
    
    <td>All string matching operations on class names, method names and argument names are performed using java regular expressions if this
    attribute is set to true. This attribute is defined once on classlevel and effects all contained annotations that refer to java names and types.
    <p>Example: the below class will inject code into all classes from the namespace "org.company". 
    <pre>
    @XClass(names={"org\\.company\\..*"},regex=true)
    class Trace
    {
    }
    </pre>
    </p>
    </td>
    
  </tr>

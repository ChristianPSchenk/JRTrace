Helper Directory to Support Attaching to JVMs
=============================================

This directory is not relevant, if JRTrace runs on a JDK. When running on a JRE, it can support attach with some tricks anyway.

When running JRTrace on Java 8:

If JRTrace or the Eclipse Environment including JRTrace runs on a JRE only (as opposed to a JDK), JRTrace will check this directory if the two files 
tools.jar and attach.dll are available. If yes, they will be used to support attaching to other JVMs.
tools.jar
attach.dll
[In what situations this is legally permissible should be checked before distributing the tool to anyone.]
To include those, create a sub-folder named with the name of the Java version e.g. 1.8.0_31 and drop the two files inside. 


Not supported yet: When running JRTrace on Java 9:

In this case the directory "java9" can contain a Java custom image created with:
"<path_to_your_java9_jdk>\bin\jlink.exe" --module-path "<path_to_your_java9_jdk>\jmods" --add-modules jdk.attach --output <path_to_this_folder>/Java9
The size is approx 18MB and can be used to support the attach functionality.

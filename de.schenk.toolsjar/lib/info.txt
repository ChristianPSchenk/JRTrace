The tools.jar from the JDK that runs JRTrace will be copied into this directory during JRTrace startup and will be used by JRTrace.
The standard source for this jar is the lib directory of the JDK the tool runs on.

If the tool shall run on a JRE, to files need to be included:
tools.jar
attach.dll
[In what situations this is legally permissible should be checked before distributing the tool to anyone.]

To include thosee, create a sub-folder named with the name of the Java version e.g. 1.8.0_31 and drop the two files inside. 
If the tool is not executed on a JDK, it will try to find these directories and use the copies provided here. Thus one copy can be provided
for each JRE version around within your organisation/scope.
